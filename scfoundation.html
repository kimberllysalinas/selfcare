		<p> <span style="font-size: 25px; color: #bf6b63;">WHAT IS SELF CARE?</span></p> 
		<hr>
		<p>Self care is a general term that describes everything you do deliberately for your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. It sounds simple, but many of us pay little attention to self-care and we must be conscious of our well being to truly care for ourselves.</p> 
		<p> <span style="font-size: 25px; color: #bf6b63;">WHY SELF CARE IS IMPORTANT?</span></p>
		<hr>
		<p>The most important thing to know about self-care is that self-care is not selfish! Self-care encourages you to maintain a healthy relationship with yourself so that you can transmit those good feelings to those around you. You cannot give to others what you don't have yourself. While some may consider self-care as selfish, it is far from that. Instead, you are reinvigorating yourself so that you can be the best version of yourself for those around you. Everyone around you also benefits from the joy and renewed energy you radiate.</p>
		<p> <span style="font-size: 25px; color: #bf6b63;">SELF CARE FOUNDATION</span></p>
		<hr>
		<p>Gordon B. Hinckley once said, "You can't build a great building on a weak foundation. You must have a solid foundation if you're going to have a strong superstructure." We need to take care of our foundation for our emotional health and well-being. Focusing on what makes us feel nourished, on what gives us meaning, is part of easing our feelings and help us create a more solid foundation for self-care. Self-care includes a myriad of practices that you can find enjoyable, all while promoting your physical, emotional, spiritual, or mental health. So, what creates a solid foundation for our well being?</p>
			<ul class="reasons">
				<li span style="font-style: italic; color: #6892ab">Rest your body</li>
				<br>
				<li>Your body needs time to rest and renew. Sleep scientists recommend that adults need at least 6-8 hours of sleep every night.  Sleep deprivation takes a toll on our physical and mental health, so even a daytime nap is an excellent way to refresh our body and can improve concentration levels.</li><br>
				<li span style="font-style: italic; color: #6892ab">Nourish your body</li>
				<br>
				<li>Nutritious foods are one of nature's best gifts to us. Make a habit out of consuming good foods that fuel your body. It's not just our physical health that can see a boost when we prioritize a healthy diet. A diet rich in vitamins and minerals is associated with a lower risk of mental health disorders including anxiety and depression. Feelings of well-being can be protected by ensuring that our diet is full of essential fats, complete carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals.</li>
				<br>
				<li span style="font-style: italic; color: #6892ab">Move your body</li>
				<br>
				<li>Physical health is a core part of self-care. Our body and mind has a unique connections, and it is difficult to be in high energy when you are not feeling good about your body. Regular exercise increases serotonin levels, which significantly improve your mood and energy. Choose to do something you enjoy doing such as swimming, a regular run, or anything that makes you feel alive. You derive extra fulfillment from doing what you love, and it is love that encourages persistence even when it seems we don't have time for it. </li>
				<br>
				<li span style="font-style: italic; color: #6892ab">Be Mindful</span></li>
				<br>
				<li>Being mindful means being present and aware of your thoughts, emotions, and how you're feeling, both physically and mentally. When we are mindful, we reduce stress, gain insight and awareness by observing our own mind and increase attention to others' well-being.</li>
			</ul>
