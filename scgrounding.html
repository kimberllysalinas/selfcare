		<h3> 20 Grounding Techniques to Quiet Distressing Thoughts and Feelings </h3>
		<p> <span style="font-weight: bold;">by: VALERIA CERVANTES | May 10, 2021</span></p>
	<div class="listing" cite="https://www.healthline.com/health/grounding-techniques">
			<p class="titles"> <span style="font-size: 25px; color: #bf6b63;">Physical Techniques</span></p>
			<hr>
			<p> <span style="font-style: italic;">These techniques use your five senses or tangible objects (things you can touch) to help you move through distress.</span></p>
			<ul class="bolden">1. Put your hands in water</ul>
			<p>Focus on the water's temperature and how it feels on your fingertips, palms, and the backs of your hands. Does it feel the same in each part of your hand? Use warm water first, then cold. Next, try cold water first, then warm. Does it feel different to switch from cold to warm water and vice versa?</p>
			<ul class="bolden">2. Pick up or touch items near you</ul>
			<p>Are the things you touch soft or hard? Heavy or light? Warm or cool? Focus on the texture and color of each item. Challenge yourself to think of specific colors, such as crimson, burgundy, indigo, or lavender, instead of simply red or blue.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">3. Breathe deeply</ul>
			<p>Slowly inhale, then exhale. If it helps, you can say or think "in" and "out" with each breath. Feel each breath filling your lungs and note how it feels to push it back out. </p>
			<ul class="bolden">4. Savor a food or drink</ul>
			<p>Take small bites or sips of a food or beverage you enjoy, letting yourself fully taste each bite. Think about how it tastes and smells and the flavors that linger on your tongue.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">5. Take a short walk</ul>
			<p> Concentrate on your steps - you can even count them. Notice the rhythm of your footsteps and how it feels to put your foot on the ground and then lift it again.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">6. Listen to your surroundings</ul>
			<p>Take a few moments to listen to the noises around you. Do you hear birds? Dogs barking? Machinery or traffic? If you hear people talking, what are they saying? Do you recognize the language? Let the sounds wash over you and remind you where you are.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">7. Try the 5-4-3-2-1 method</ul>
			<p>Working backwards from 5, use your senses to list things you notice around you. For example, start by listing five things you hear, four things you see, three things you can touch from where you are sitting, two things you can smell, and one thing you can taste. Or, try listing five things around you that are blue, four things that are red, three things that are green, two things that are yellow, and one thing that is purple.</p>

			<p class="titles"> <span style="font-size: 25px; color: #bf6b63;">Mental Techniques</span></p>
			<hr>
			<p> <span style="font-style: italic;"> These grounding exercises use mental distractions to help redirect your thoughts away from distressing feelings and back to the present.</span></p>
			<ul class="bolden">8. Play a memory game</ul>
			<p>Look at a detailed photograph or picture for 5 to 10 seconds. Then, turn the photograph face-down 
			<ul class="bolden">9. Think in categories</ul>
			<p>Choose one or two broad categories, such as "musical instruments," "ive cream flavors," or "mammals." Take a minute or two to mentally list as many things from each category as you can.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">10. Recite something</ul>
			<p>Think of a poem, song, or book passage you know by heart. Recite it quietly to yourself in your head. If you say the words aloud, focus on the shape of each words on your lips and and in your mouth. If you say the words in your hear, visualize each word as you would see it on a page.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">11. Describe a common task</ul>
			<p>Think of an activity you do often or can do very well, such as making coffee, locking up your office, or tuning a guitar. Go through the process step-by-step, as if you're giving someone else instructions on how to do it.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">12. Imagine yourself leaving the painful feelings behind</ul>
			<p>Picture yourself:</p>
			<p>gathering the emotions, balling them up, and putting them into a box</p>
			<p>walking, swimming, biking, or jogging away from painful feelings</p>
			<p>imagine your thoughts as a song or TV show you dislike, changing the channel or turning down the volume - they're still there, but you don't have to listen to them.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">13. Describe what's around you</ul>
			<p>Spend a few minutes taking in your surroundings and noting what you see. Use all five senses to provide as much detail as possible. "This bench is red, but the bench over there is green. It's warm under my jeans since I'm sitting in the sin. It feels rough, but there aren't any splinters. The grass is yellow and dry. The air smells like smoke. I hear kids having fun and dogs barking."</p>

			<hr>
			<p> <span style="font-style: italic;"> You can use these techniques to comfort yourself in times of emotional distress. These exercises can help promote good feelings that may help the negative feelings fade or seem less overwhelming.</span></p>	
			<ul class="bolden">14. Picture the voice or face of someone you love</ul>
			<p>If you feel upset or distressed, visualize someone positive in your life. Imagine their face or think of what their voice sounds like. Imagine them telling you that the moment is tough, but that you'll get through it.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">15. Practice self-kindness</ul>
			<p>Repeat kind, compassionate phrases to yourself:</p>
			<p>"You're having a rough time, but you'll make it through."</p>
			<p>"You're strong, and you can move through this pain."</p>
			<p>"You're trying hard, and you're doing your best."</p>
			<p>Say it, either aloud or in your head, as many times as you need.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">16. Sit with your pet</ul>
			<p>If you're at home and have a pet, spend a few minutes just sitting with them. If they're of the furry variety, pet them, focusing on how their fur feels. Focus on their markings or unique characteristics. If you have a smaller pet you can hold, concentrate on how they feel in your hand.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">17. List favorites</ul>
			<p>List three favorite things in several different categories, such as foods, trees, songs, movies, books, places, and so on.</p>
			<ul class="bolden">18. Visualize your favorite place</ul>
			<p>Think of your favorite place, whether it's the home of a loved on or a foreign country. Use all of your senses to create a mental image. Think of the colors you see, sounds you hear, and sensations you feel on your skin.</p>
			<p>Remember the last time you were there. Who were you with, if anyone? What did you do there? How did you feel?</p>
			<ul class="bolden">19. Plan an activity</ul>
			<p>This might be something you do alone or with a friend or loved one. Think of what you'll do and when. Maybe you'll go to dinner, take a walk on the beach, see a movie you've been looking forward to, or visit a museum.</p>
			<p>Focus on the details, such as what you'll wear, when you'll go, and how you'll get there</p>
			<ul class="bolden">20. Listen to music</ul>
			<p>Put on your favorite song, but pretend you're listening to it for the first time. Focus on the melody and lyrics (if there are any). Does the song give you chills or create any other physical sensations? Pay attention to the parts that stand out most to you</p>
